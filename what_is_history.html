    <p class="paragraph">The definition of history is basically every event or action that happened
       in the past, the word comes from the word “Histor” in Greek which means “Witness/who saws”, but it has many definitions.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">It has many divisions which include world history, national history, personal
       history, history of communities, and many others.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">‘Herodotus’ is considered the father of sciences and therefore, of history.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">When experts apply the scientific method in the study of history, the historiography is made.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">In historiography, the history is studied as a science, using observation,
      theories, laws, and by different points of view.</p>
